It stretches over 13,000 miles (21,000 km) across China's northern borders. Originally constructed during the 7th century BC, it was continuously expanded and fortified by successive Chinese dynasties, with the most famous versions built during the Qin and Ming dynasties. The wall is not only a remarkable engineering feat but also a testament to China's rich history and cultural heritage. While it's often claimed to be visible from space, this is a myth; it's only about 30 feet wide and blends in with the Earth's surface from afar. The Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction, with sections like Badaling and Mutianyu being favorites among visitors.

okay now ill give you APi Endpoint 
from where youll get reposne so You have to hit that endpoint for Cht 
{
    "message": "Hey Im Chinmay ",
    "conversation_id": "12345",
    "model_name": "",
    "temperature": 0,
    "context": [],
    "user_id": "14"
}

This is the format where message will be user querry as we are taking each node a unique convo id so in conversation_id put that id then model name is the model name that user can select from Drop Down then keep deafult temprature 0.7 then in context you need to send all parent node ids as alist of branch and user id will be Users ID
